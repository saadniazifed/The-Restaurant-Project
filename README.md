## The Restaurant Project.

A Steak-House Restaurant Project made using ES6 Modules and applying the knowledge of Webpack.

The tenth project in the Javascript section of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

Spec and details for the assignment can be found [Here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-restaurant-page)

Use it Live in the browser [Here](https://saadniazifed.github.io/the-restaurant-project/)


## Features

* See the restaurant project in the browser.
* The project has a tab system. Upon clicking on each tab, the content gets erased on the current tab, and new content gets added.
* This project uses Modules for the first time - Each piece of code is kept in its own JavaScript module.
* For the first time, ES6 Modules are used to Import and Export the code.
* Webpack is used to compile the code. 

## How to use

* Use it Live in the browser [Here](https://saadniazifed.github.io/the-restaurant-project/)
* By clicking each tab of the restaurant, you will see the current content being replaced by the content of that specific tab.

## Possible future additions

None that I can find. Project is completed as it is.


### UI / UX
* The restaurant project is a simplified version of an actual steakhouse. 
* It contains a Home Page, a Menu Page and a Contact Us page.
* Upon clicking each tab, the content gets replaced by the tab you're currently on.
* Buttons contain a color change based on the hover effect.
* Flexbox is used for the layout.

## Known Bugs
None. Everything was fixed before deployment.

## Reflections
Learning about ES6 Modules and Webpack was intimidating at first, but after applying the knowledge, concepts and probelm solving techniques on this project, I had the necessary practice I needed to use ES6 Modules and Webpack on a daily basis. This project was used as a practic to learn how Modules and Webpack works.
